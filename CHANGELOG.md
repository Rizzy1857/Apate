## [Unreleased]

### Architecture Transformation

- **Project Mirage**: Complete architecture redesign from basic honeypot to five-layer cognitive deception framework
- **MTTD Focus**: Primary metric changed to Mean Time To Discovery with 9-12x improvement target

- **Layer 1**: Hidden Markov Models for command sequence prediction (planned Q1 2026)
- **Layer 2**: Machine Learning behavioral classification (planned Q2 2026)
- **Layer 3**: Reinforcement Learning strategy optimization (planned Q3 2026)
- **Layer 4**: LLM-based persona generation (planned Q4 2026)

### Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with new Mirage architecture overview
- Revised progress.md to reflect five-layer implementation plan
- Added AI_Engine_Plan.md with comprehensive technical roadmap
- Updated project status to show foundation completion (87%)

### Planned Implementation

- Phase 1 (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026): Layers 0+1 targeting 15-20 minute MTTD
- Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026): Layer 2 addition targeting 25-35 minute MTTD  
- Phase 3 (Q2-Q3 2026): Layer 3 addition targeting 35-50 minute MTTD
- Phase 4 (Q3-Q4 2026): Layer 4 completion targeting 45-60+ minute MTTD

*Note: This project has evolved from "Apate" (basic honeypot) to "Project Mirage" (cognitive deception framework). The foundation components serve as Layer 0 baseline for the advanced architecture.*
