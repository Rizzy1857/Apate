  - Pod-to-pod communication restrictions
  - Namespace isolation rules
  - Ingress/egress traffic control
  - Management interface isolation

### ✅ **6. Secrets Management & Key Rotation**
- **`scripts/secrets_management.sh`** - Enterprise secrets handling
  - AES-256 encryption for all secrets
  - Age encryption with secure key management
  - Automatic rotation scheduling (API keys: 30 days, passwords: 90 days)
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Fake credentials generation for honeypot deception
  - Docker Compose integration with secure environment files

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### **1. Initialize Security Framework**
```bash
# Run security hardening (as root)
sudo ./scripts/security_hardening.sh

# Initialize secrets management
sudo ./scripts/secrets_management.sh init

# Setup advanced firewall rules
sudo ./scripts/advanced_firewall.sh
```

### **2. Deploy Security-Hardened Honeypot**
```bash
# Deploy with security configurations
docker-compose -f docker-compose-security.yml up -d

# Deploy monitoring stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yml up -d
```

### **3. Verify Security Implementation**
```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo iptables -L -n --line-numbers

# Verify ipset configurations
sudo ipset list

# Check container security
docker inspect mirage-backend | grep -A 10 "SecurityOpt"

# Monitor security logs
tail -f /var/log/mirage-firewall.log
```
## 🔥 **Key Security Advantages**
