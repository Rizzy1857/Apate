# Project Mirage - Adaptive Deception Framework

⚠️**Archived**: The project is being archived as it functions as a great prototype but fails to grow into a final project, having many fatal issues. Till I find a solution for these issues, I will be working on other projects, feel free to browse the repo and suggest changes if you have any.

An intelligent honeypot system built on a staged cognitive architecture with a five-layer research roadmap. Mirage augments the robust Apate foundation with progressive, advisory-only behavioral modeling to improve Mean Time To Discovery (MTTD) through context-enrichment rather than autonomous decision-making.

**Primary Metric**: Mean Time To Discovery (MTTD)  
**Current Baseline**: 2–5 minutes (static honeypot)  
**Projected Research Target**: 45–60+ minutes (pending real-world observation data)  
**All MTTD figures beyond Phase 1 are research projections, not validated metrics.**

## 🎯 What Makes Mirage Different

### The Advisory Cascade

All layers operate in a cascading advisory model—progressively enriching security context without enforcing hard decisions until explicitly authorized. This humility-first design avoids false positives, autonomous blocking, and unintended network impact.

### Five-Layer Cognitive Architecture (Research Roadmap)

- **Layer 0 – Reflex Layer** ✅ (Operational): Fast, deterministic threat tagging in Rust; no intelligence, pure routing
- **Layer 1 – Intuition Layer** ✅ (Operational, advisory-only): Probabilistic sequence modeling (PST-based) to predict likely attacker actions and emit behavioral continuity signals
- **Layer 2 – Reasoning Layer** (Specification-only; advisory-only when implemented): ML-based behavioral clustering to contextualize attacker profiles and influence threat scoring
- **Layer 3 – Strategy Layer** (Specification-only; not implemented): RL-based long-term engagement optimization via strategy generation  
- **Layer 4 – Persona Layer** (Specification-only; not implemented): Context-aware conversational responses using LLMs

### Operational Principles

- **Predict, Don't Act**: Layers 0–2 enrich context; they never block or modify traffic unilaterally
- **Observable Degradation**: System gracefully reduces capability under load (Layers 2+ drop first)
- **Guardrails Dormant**: Privacy and safety modules exist as specifications, not runtime enforcement
- **Passive-Only Observation Phase**: Jan–Mar 2026 data collection with predict-only gating

## 📊 **Project Status**

> **Observation Phase Active (Jan–Mar 2026)**: Layers 0–1 deployed in passive (predict-only) mode for 30–60 days of clean data collection. Layer 2+ are currently specification-only; runtime implementation begins Q2 2026. Guardrails (privacy, safety) exist as architectural specs, not active enforcement. Full test suite (66 tests) passing. See [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for implementation details.
